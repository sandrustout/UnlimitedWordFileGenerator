**Flexible Word List Generator**
_**A Python script that generates a text file containing all possible combinations of words based on user-specified parameters. This tool is especially useful for generating large lists of words for brute-forcing, testing, and data generation needs**_.

**Features**
**Dynamic Word Length**: Starts with a minimum word length of 8 and increases automatically to meet the required number of unique words.
**Customizable Character Set**: Supports lowercase, uppercase, numerals, and special characters, with options to include or exclude each category.
**Efficient Memory Usage**: Uses generators to avoid memory issues and writes directly to the file as words are generated, handling large data requests smoothly.

# Unlimited Word File Generator
A Python-based tool to generate large wordlist files for custom needs. Useful for brute-forcing, testing, or other purposes.
- Customizable character sets (lowercase, uppercase, numerals).
- Adjustable word length and number of words.
- Outputs to a text file.

### Direct Download via `curl`
Run the following commands in your terminal:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandrustout/unlimitedwordfilegenerator/main/main.py
chmod +x main.py
./main.py --filename wordlist --caps --numerals --min-length 8 --num-words 1000



**Usage**
**Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.**
_git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>_

**Run the script:**
_python generate_flexible_ordered_words.py_

**Input parameters:**
**Filename**: Base name of the output file (will be saved as <filename>.txt).
**Uppercase Letters**: Choose if words should include uppercase letters (yes or no).
**Numerals**: Choose if words should include numerals (yes or no).
**Special Characters**: Choose if words should include special characters (yes or no).
**Number of Words**: Specify the total number of words to generate.


**Example**
_Enter the filename (without .txt extension): wordlist
Should words contain uppercase letters? (yes or no): yes
Should words contain numerals? (yes or no): no
Should words contain special characters? (yes or no): no
How many words do you want to generate? 1000000
This will create a file named wordlist.txt containing 1,000,000 words, each composed of lowercase and uppercase letters only, and starting with words of length 8._

**_How It Works
Dynamic Character Pool: The script constructs a character pool based on the selected options (lowercase, uppercase, numerals, special characters)._**
Lexicographical Order: Words are generated in lexicographical order (e.g., aaaaaaaa, aaaaaaab).
Adaptive Length: Starting with 8 characters, the script increments the word length as needed to reach the desired number of words.
Efficient File Writing: To handle very large lists (millions or billions of words), the script writes each word to the file as itâ€™s generated, ensuring minimal memory usage.
